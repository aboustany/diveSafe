# diveSafe

This GitHub repository contains an implementation of the DiveSafe application created as a project for the Model-Based Programming class at McGill University. 

The project was conducted in teams of 6, over a three month span. The first step of the project involved modeling our application with UMPLE and a UML diagram, before implementing it in Java and testing it using Gradle.
